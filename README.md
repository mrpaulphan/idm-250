## Installing WordPress
- WordPress needs a database to store all website data, so you will need to create a database before we install WordPress. Don’t worry, it’s not as hard as it sounds.
- Create a Database for your current enviorment. For example, `local_idm250_wp`
- Download the latest version of WP from [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/download/)
- First you need to visit the WordPress.org website to download a copy of WordPress. After downloading the file, you need to unzip it.

Next, copy the wordpress folder inside and paste it into your servers root folder.

- Go to `http://{your-local-domain-here}/wp-admin`
