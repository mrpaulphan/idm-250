# Assignment Overview
The goal of this assignment is to take your Post Detail (single.php) design and develop it in WP.

## Single Page

#### If You have a Blog
Using [single.php](https://github.com/mrpaulphan/idm250/blob/master/public/wp-content/themes/portfolio-theme/single.php) as an example, add this to your template and create a page that will dynamically pull in the page title, and page builder. Feel free to add any other additional content such as date, tags, categories, and featured image if you design has it. If you're feeling frisky, you can try messing around with [Advance Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) and adding custom fields that your design needs.

This page should include the following components styles:
- Headings 1 - 6
- Unordered list
- Ordered List
- Paragraphs
- Pull Quotes
- Links, bold, italic, and underline
- Images with caption

#### If You have a Custom Post Type such as "Projects"
Using `single-{post-type-name}.php` as an example, add this to your template and create a page that will dynamically pull in the page title, and page builder. Feel free to add any other additional content such as date, tags, categories, and featured image if you design has it. If you're feeling frisky, you can try messing around with [Advance Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) and adding custom fields that your design needs.
